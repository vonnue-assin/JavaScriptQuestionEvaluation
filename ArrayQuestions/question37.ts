//Write a JavaScript program to find the nth ugly number.

// To determine if a given positive integer \(n\) is an ugly number, you can repeatedly divide \(n\) by 2, 3, and 5 as long as it is divisible by them. If, after all possible divisions, the number reduces to 1, then the original number was ugly.
